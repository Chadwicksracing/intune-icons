# Applications Icons for Intune (or MDM)

A set of application icons for Windows, macOS, Android and iOS platforms for use when adding applications to Intune (or other MDM solutions).

Applications are displayed in the Intune Company Portal app or via https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/ for other platforms for self-service install. Using familiar, high quality, icons ensures users see a familiar interface when accessing applications.

Where possible, icons have been added in their largest size and best possible quality. All icons have been optimised for size using PNGCrush, PNGOUT etc.
